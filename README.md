# petra

My new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is lightweight and user-friendly app built for quick and precise unit conversions in the oil and gas sector. It supports conversions for pressure (psi, bar, kPa), volume (barrels, cubic meters, gallons), and flow rate (bpd, mÂ³/d, L/s). The app also includes a settings menu where users can personalize their experience by selecting preferred units and themes. Whether you're in the office or out in the field, Petra ensures seamless, hassle-free conversions whenever you need them.
